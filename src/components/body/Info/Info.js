        I am a self-taught frontend developer with experience in building
        websites and web applications as part of personal projects. I am
        currently looking for an opportunity to continue developing my skills in
        the commercial environment.
        <br />
        <br />I have completed numerous web courses on technologies like{" "}

          HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux, Git,
        </span>{" "}
        and <span className="technologies">Material UI</span>. Simultaneously, I
        have been gaining practical experience while working on personal

        During my humanities studies, I have developed critical and logical
        thinking skills that I consider essential in the work of a programmer. I
        am problem-solving-oriented and find myself comfortable in the teamwork
        environment.
